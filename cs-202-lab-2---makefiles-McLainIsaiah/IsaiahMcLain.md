When doing this assignment the biggest issue I had was dealing with the makefile as I didn't know how to remove the executable. It took me a little while to figure it out but I discovered that within the first makefile line you create the executable, which I called average. In order to clean the executable you just type it next to the *.o to get rm *.o averager. This cleans not only the executable but object files. I also struggled with making the code run at first with the makefile because I was experimenting with how to remove the executable file and this cause weird error messages that were hard to decode and understand what was actually going wrong in the background.
