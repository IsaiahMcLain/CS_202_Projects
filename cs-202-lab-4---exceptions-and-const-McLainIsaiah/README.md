## Learning Targets
- LT21: I can use exceptions appropriately for error handling

### Important Notes:
- **Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.

## Program Description
 
The files have been provided for a complete Book Store project. The program includes compilation errors and one or more runtime errors. Your goal is simple: make the changes required to make the program compile and run without errors.

### Step 1
Try to compile the program. What error(s) do you see? Modify the appropriate files to eliminate the error(s).

### Step 2
The program should compile now, but you should encounter one or more runtime errors. Modify the appropriate file(s) to eliminate the errors (**without eliminating any existing code**).

### Expected Output
When you have completed steps 1 and 2, you should be able to run the program and get this output:

## Submission details
In a console in your project directory, enter the following commands

```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push origin master
```
**Note that you can commit many times. Each time, use a commit message that relates to what you have changed. For example, it might be "fixed an issue with a runtime error".**

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work off another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitutes academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrollment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
